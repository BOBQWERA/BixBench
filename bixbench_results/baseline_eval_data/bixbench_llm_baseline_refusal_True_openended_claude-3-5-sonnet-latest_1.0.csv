Removing the third replicate from both conditions typically reduces statistical power, leading to fewer significantly differentially expressed genes being identified. This occurs because:
1. Less data points decrease confidence in expression differences
2. Higher variance estimates due to fewer replicates
3. More stringent statistical thresholds required to achieve significance

The exact reduction in significant genes depends on data quality and biological variation, but generally expect a 20-30% decrease in differentially expressed genes identified.
